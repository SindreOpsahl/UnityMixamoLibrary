# UnityMixamoLibrary
The Mixamo mocap library imported into Unity and setup for Mecanim Humanoid.

I've attempted to organize and rename things sensibly. Many will probably not match the names or descriptions they have on Mixamo's website. 

I've made my best guess at root motion settings, but haven't tested them yet so many may be wrong.

There may be missing animations. The archive file I found was a few years old. 

Feel free to report any errors, bad names, and missing files and I will do my best to fix them.

As of 28/01/2020 the conversion process is still not done. When I have finished organizing and configuring root motion for all the animations I will export a unitypackage to Releases which can be imported into any project.
